# Velocity-Engine
This Game Engine was created using the latest generation technologies. Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS with Electron and Three.js frameworks. This solution will allow you to create 3d and 2d games natively by abandoning the "Leader" languages (such as C ++) and replacing it with JavaScript. The build processes will only be able to compile for PC, Mac, Linux, Android, Web and IOs, but we will progress to offer support for the PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch SDKs in the future.
